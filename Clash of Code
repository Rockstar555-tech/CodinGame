# The program:
Given two angles of a triangle, calculate the third angle.

# INPUT:
A single line containing the two angles a et b separated by a space.

# OUTPUT:
A single line containing the last angle c.

# CONSTRAINTS:
1≤a<180
1≤b<180

# EXAMPLE:
Input
1 1
Output
178
# solution...
a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
c = 180-(a+b)
print(c)
